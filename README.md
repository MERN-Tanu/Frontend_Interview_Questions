    ```

14. How to optimise websites assets loading?

```
- CDN hosting : Content delivery network is geographically     distributed servers to help reduce latency (that experiences very small delay).

- File compression : reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer

- File Concatenation : this reduces the number of http calls
- Minify Script : this reduces the overall file size of js and css files

- Parallel downloads :

```

```
Lazy Loading : (Page will load take sometime)

Lazy loading is a technique for waiting to load certain parts of a webpage ‚Äî especially images ‚Äî until they are needed. Instead of loading everything all at once, known as "eager" loading, the browser does not request certain resources until the user interacts in such a way that the resources are needed.

15. What are the different kinds of Doctypes available?
    The three kinds of Doctypes which are available:
    Strict Doctype
    Transitional Doctype
    Frameset Doctype

16. Please explain how to indicate the character set being used by a document in HTML?
    The character set is defined in <meta> tag inside <head> element.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    ... ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

17. Can we display a web page inside a web page or Is nesting of webpages possible?
    Yes, we can display a web page inside another HTML web page. HTML provides a tag <iframe> using which we can achieve this functionality.

    ```html
    <iframe src="‚Äùurl" of the web page to embed‚Äù />
    ```

```
18. In how many ways can we position an HTML element? Or what are the permissible values of the position attribute?


There are mainly 7 values of position attribute that can be used to position an HTML element:

static: Default value. Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

absolute: Here the element is positioned relative to its parent element. The final position is determined by the values of left, right, top, bottom.

fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are positioned relative to the <html> element.

relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal position.

initial: This resets the property to its default value.

inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent
```

```
19.In how many ways you can display HTML elements?

inline: Using this we can display any block-level element as an inline element. The height and width attribute values of the element will not affect.

block: using this, we can display any inline element as a block-level element.

inline-block: This property is similar to inline, except by using the display as inline-block, we can actually format the element using height and width values.

flex: It displays the container and element as a flexible structure. It follows flexbox property.

inline-flex: It displays the flex container as an inline element while its content follows the flexbox properties.

grid: It displays the HTML elements as a grid container.

none: Using this property we can hide the HTML element.
```

```

20.What is the difference between ‚Äúdisplay: none‚Äù and ‚Äúvisibility: hidden‚Äù, when used as attributes to the HTML element.


When we use the attribute ‚Äúvisibility: hidden‚Äù for an HTML element then that element will be hidden from the webpage but still takes up space.

Whereas, if we use the ‚Äúdisplay: none‚Äù attribute for an HTML element then the element will be hidden, and also it won‚Äôt take up any space on the webpage.

```

```
21.In how many ways can we specify the CSS styles for the HTML element?

Inline: Here we use the ‚Äòstyle‚Äô attribute inside the HTML element.

Internal: Here we use the <style> tag inside the <head> tag. To apply the style we bind the elements using ‚Äòid‚Äô or ‚Äòclass‚Äô attributes.

External: Here we use the <link> tag inside <head> tag to reference the CSS file into our HTML code. Again the binding between elements and styles is done using ‚Äòid‚Äô or ‚Äòclass‚Äô attributes.

```
